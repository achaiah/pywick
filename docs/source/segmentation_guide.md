## Segmentation

In a short while we will publish a walk-through that will go into detail
on how to do segmentation with Pywick. In the meantime, if you feel
adventurous feel free to look at our
[README](https://github.com/achaiah/pywick/blob/master/README.md).

You can also take a look at our [Classification guide](https://github.com/achaiah/pywick/blob/master/docs/source/classification_guide.md) to get a good idea of how to get started on your own. The segmentation training process is very similar but involves more complicated directory structure for data.
