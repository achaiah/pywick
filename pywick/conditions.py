"""
Conditions are useful for any custom pre- and post-processing that must be done on batches of data.
Module trainer maintains two separate condition lists that are executed before/after the network forward pass.

An example of a condition could be an Assert that needs to be performed before data is processed.
A more advanced example of a condition could be code that modifies the network based on input or output
