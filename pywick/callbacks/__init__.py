Callbacks are the primary mechanism by which one can embed event hooks into the training process. Many useful callbacks are provided
out of the box but in all likelihood you will want to implement your own to execute actions based on training events. To do so,
simply extend the pywick.callbacks.Callback class and overwrite functions that you are interested in acting upon.
