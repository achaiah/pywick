#### High-Level Training framework for Pytorch

Pywick is a high-level Pytorch training framework that aims to get you
up and running quickly with state of the art neural networks. *Does the
world need another Pytorch framework?* Probably not. But we started this
project when no good frameworks were available and it just kept growing.
So here we are.

Pywick tries to stay on the bleeding edge of research into neural networks. If you just wish to run a vanilla CNN, this is probably
going to be overkill. However, if you want to get lost in the world of neural networks, fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization
for months on end then this is probably the right place for you :)

Among other things Pywick includes:
- State of the art normalization, activation, loss functions and optimizers not included in the standard Pytorch library (AdaBelief, Addsign, Apollo, Eve, Lookahead, Radam, Ralamb, RangerLARS etc).
- A high-level module for training with callbacks, constraints, metrics, conditions and regularizers.
- Hundreds of popular object classification and semantic segmentation models!
- Comprehensive data loading, augmentation, transforms, and sampling capability.
- Utility tensor functions.
- Useful meters.
- Basic GridSearch (exhaustive and random).

## Docs
Hey, [check this out](https://pywick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), we now have [docs](https://pywick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)! They're still a work in progress though so apologies for anything that's broken.

## Install
Pywick requires **pytorch >= 1.4**

`pip install pywick`

or specific version from git:

`pip install git+https://github.com/achaiah/pywick.git@v0.6.0`

## ModuleTrainer
The `ModuleTrainer` class provides a high-level training interface which abstracts away the training loop while providing callbacks, constraints, initializers, regularizers,
and more.

See the `train_classifier.py` example for a pretty complete configuration example. To get up and running with your own data quickly simply edit the `configs/train_classifier.yaml` file with your desired parameters and dataset location(s).

Note: <i>Dataset needs to be organized for classification where each directory name is the name of a class and contains all images pertaining to that class</i>

PyWick provides a wide range of <b>callbacks</b>, generally mimicking the interface found in `Keras`:

- `CSVLogger` - Logs epoch-level metrics to a CSV file
- [`CyclicLRScheduler`](https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR) - Cycles through min-max learning rate
- `EarlyStopping` - Provides ability to stop training early based on supplied criteria
- `History` - Keeps history of metrics etc. during the learning process
- `LambdaCallback` - Allows you to implement your own callbacks on the fly
- `LRScheduler` - Simple learning rate scheduler based on function or supplied schedule
- `ModelCheckpoint` - Comprehensive model saver
- `ReduceLROnPlateau` - Reduces learning rate (LR) when a plateau has been reached
- `SimpleModelCheckpoint` - Simple model saver
- Additionally, a `TensorboardLogger` is incredibly easy to implement via tensorboardX (now part of pytorch 1.1 release!)


```python
from pywick.callbacks import EarlyStopping

callbacks = [EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)]
trainer.set_callbacks(callbacks)
```

PyWick also provides <b>regularizers</b>:

- `L1Regularizer`
- `L2Regularizer`
- `L1L2Regularizer`


and <b>constraints</b>:
- `UnitNorm`
- `MaxNorm`
- `NonNeg`

Both regularizers and constraints can be selectively applied on layers using regular expressions and the `module_filter`
argument. Constraints can be explicit (hard) constraints applied at an arbitrary batch or
epoch frequency, or they can be implicit (soft) constraints similar to regularizers
where the constraint deviation is added as a penalty to the total model loss.

```python
from pywick.constraints import MaxNorm, NonNeg
from pywick.regularizers import L1Regularizer

# hard constraint applied every 5 batches
hard_constraint = MaxNorm(value=2., frequency=5, unit='batch', module_filter='*fc*')
# implicit constraint added as a penalty term to model loss
soft_constraint = NonNeg(lagrangian=True, scale=1e-3, module_filter='*fc*')
constraints = [hard_constraint, soft_constraint]
trainer.set_constraints(constraints)

regularizers = [L1Regularizer(scale=1e-4, module_filter='*conv*')]
trainer.set_regularizers(regularizers)
```

You can also fit directly on a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` and can have
a validation set as well :

```python
from pywick import TensorDataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

train_dataset = TensorDataset(x_train, y_train)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32)

val_dataset = TensorDataset(x_val, y_val)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32)

trainer.fit_loader(loader, val_loader=val_loader, num_epoch=100)
```

###### To load one of these models:
[Read the docs](https://pywick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pywick.models.html)
for useful details! Then dive in:
```python
# use the `get_model` utility
from pywick.models.model_utils import get_model, ModelType

model = get_model(model_type=ModelType.CLASSIFICATION, model_name='resnet18', num_classes=1000, pretrained=True)
```
For a complete list of models (including many experimental ones) you can call the `get_supported_models` method e.g. 
`pywick.models.model_utils.get_supported_models(ModelType.SEGMENTATION)`

## Data Augmentation and Datasets
The PyWick package provides wide variety of good data augmentation and transformation
tools which can be applied during data loading. The package also provides the flexible
`TensorDataset`, `FolderDataset` and `MultiFolderDataset` classes to handle most dataset needs.

### Torch Transforms
##### These transforms work directly on torch tensors

- `AddChannel`
- `ChannelsFirst`
- `ChannelsLast`
- `Compose`
- `ExpandAxis`
- `Pad`
- `PadNumpy`
- `RandomChoiceCompose`
- `RandomCrop`
- `RandomFlip`
- `RandomOrder`
- `RangeNormalize`
- `Slice2D`
- `SpecialCrop`
- `StdNormalize`
- `ToFile`
- `ToNumpyType`
- `ToTensor`
- `Transpose`
- `TypeCast`

##### Additionally, we provide image-specific manipulations directly on tensors:

- `Brightness`
- `Contrast`
- `Gamma`
- `Grayscale`
- `RandomBrightness`
- `RandomChoiceBrightness`
- `RandomChoiceContrast`
- `RandomChoiceGamma`
- `RandomChoiceSaturation`
- `RandomContrast`
- `RandomGamma`
- `RandomGrayscale`
- `RandomSaturation`
- `Saturation`

#####  Affine Transforms (perform affine or affine-like transforms on torch tensors)

- `RandomAffine`
- `RandomChoiceRotate`
- `RandomChoiceShear`
- `RandomChoiceTranslate`
- `RandomChoiceZoom`
- `RandomRotate`
- `RandomShear`
- `RandomSquareZoom`
- `RandomTranslate`
- `RandomZoom`
- `Rotate`
- `Shear`
- `Translate`
- `Zoom`

We also provide a class for stringing multiple affine transformations together so that only one interpolation takes place:

- `Affine` 
- `AffineCompose`

##### Blur and Scramble transforms (for tensors)
- `Blur`
- `RandomChoiceBlur`
- `RandomChoiceScramble`
- `Scramble`

### Datasets and Sampling
We provide the following datasets which provide general structure and iterators for sampling from and using transforms on in-memory or out-of-memory data. In particular,
the [FolderDataset](pywick/datasets/FolderDataset.py) has been designed to fit most of your dataset needs. It has extensive options for data filtering and manipulation.
It supports loading images for classification, segmentation and even arbitrary source/target mapping. Take a good look at its documentation for more info.

- `ClonedDataset`
- `CSVDataset`
- `FolderDataset`
- `MultiFolderDataset`
- `TensorDataset`
- `tnt.BatchDataset`
- `tnt.ConcatDataset`
- `tnt.ListDataset`
- `tnt.MultiPartitionDataset`
- `tnt.ResampleDataset`
- `tnt.ShuffleDataset`
- `tnt.TensorDataset`
- `tnt.TransformDataset`

### Imbalanced Datasets
In many scenarios it is important to ensure that your traing set is properly balanced,
however, it may not be practical in real life to obtain such a perfect dataset. In these cases 
you can use the `ImbalancedDatasetSampler` as a drop-in replacement for the basic sampler provided
by the DataLoader. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/ufoym/imbalanced-dataset-sampler)

```python
from pywick.samplers import ImbalancedDatasetSampler

train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, 
    sampler=ImbalancedDatasetSampler(train_dataset),
    batch_size=args.batch_size, **kwargs)
```

## Utility Functions
PyWick provides a few utility functions not commonly found:

### Tensor Functions
- `th_iterproduct` (mimics itertools.product)
- `th_gather_nd` (N-dimensional version of torch.gather)
- `th_random_choice` (mimics np.random.choice)
- `th_pearsonr` (mimics scipy.stats.pearsonr)
- `th_corrcoef` (mimics np.corrcoef)
- `th_affine2d` and `th_affine3d` (affine transforms on torch.Tensors)
